This repository is home to a WIP project of a simple webpage containing different kinds of games.

Right now, it has got:

1. **Tic-Tac-Toe.** :x: :o:
    1. Featuring a simple player versus computer mode. At the moment, the computer follows a random procedure to place in its moves.
    2. A Player vs. Player (PvP) mode is available. In the future, it will be added a "switch symbols" button.
2. More games will be added.

**Note:** *In the future, the webpage may include translations into other languages.*
**Note:** *Currently, a game selector is not available. It will be included in the future.*
