This repository is home to a WIP project of a simple webpage containing different kinds of games.

Right now, it has got:

1. **Tic-Tac-Toe.** :x: :o:
    1. Featuring a simple player versus computer mode. At the moment, the computer follows a random procedure to place in its moves.
    2. A Player vs. Player (PvP) mode is available. In the future, it will be added a "switch symbols" button.
2. More games will be added.

**New!** A game selector has been added in the form of a navigation menu. It will be enhanced with more options as they're added. It has a *not working* contacts page link, which will be added in the future.

**Note:** *In the future, the webpage may include translations into other languages. In the navigation menu a non-functional language selector was added.*

In this section, I will mention everyone who collaborated in either way to this little project's advancements. A huge thank you to all of you.

- The player vs. computer Tic Tac Toe made with HTML, CSS and JS was inspired by a tutorial on [dev.to](https://dev.to/ayushmanbthakur/how-to-make-tic-tac-toe-in-browser-with-html-css-and-js-28ed) written by Ayushman B. 
- The original version of navigation menu used in the webpage was coded by erikterwan on [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/erikterwan/pen/EVzeRP).
